# CLAUDE.md

## What this is

An MCP server that offloads coding tasks to the Codex CLI as background jobs. Claude calls
`codex_start`, gets a job id back immediately, keeps working, and collects the result later.

The point of the whole project is **non-blocking delegation**. Codex's own `codex mcp-server`
already covers the synchronous case; if a change here would make a tool block until Codex
finishes, it belongs in the built-in server instead, not this one.

## When to offload

**There is no orchestrator.** Nothing in this repo decides what gets delegated. There is no
router, no scheduler, no heuristic — the only thing steering the choice is the `codex_start`
description in `src/index.ts`, which the calling model reads at call time and judges against.
Everything below is that judgment written down, not behaviour the code enforces.

Offload when *all* of these hold:

- **Self-contained.** The task fits in a prompt. Codex cannot see the conversation, so anything
  depending on what was just worked out must be restated in full. If restating it is most of the
  work, offloading is a net loss.
- **Slow.** Minutes, not seconds. Below ~30s the round trip costs more than it saves.
- **There is real work to do meanwhile.** Dispatching and then polling gains nothing and makes the
  result harder to verify.
- **Verifiable afterwards.** Mechanical enough that `actualChanges` from git shows whether it went
  right.
- **Scoped to one `cwd`.** Codex writes to disk directly; ambiguous scope means unwanted edits.

Do it in-process when the task needs conversation context, is fast, is exploratory (direction
changes based on what each step finds), blocks the next decision, or is surgical enough that
specifying it precisely costs more than doing it.

**Exploratory work is the main trap.** Investigations where each measurement changes what you look
at next cannot be offloaded: by the time the prompt can be written, the thinking is done. A useful
tell is a wrong hypothesis — if you expect to have one, keep the work in-process.

Misjudging is asymmetric: a bad delegation writes files to disk. That asymmetry is why
`codex_result` checks Codex's self-report against git rather than trusting it — the design already
assumes a delegation can be wrong. Prefer `sandbox: "read-only"` for anything analytical.

### Policies

Standing rules that override the judgment above. The list is empty by design — the default is
model judgment, and each entry is a deliberate narrowing of it. Append here rather than editing
the prose above, so the default and the exceptions stay separable.

Format: one bullet per rule, imperative, with the reason on the same line — the reason is what lets
a later reader tell a still-valid rule from a stale one.

<!-- Example of the intended shape (not an active rule):
- Never offload anything touching `src/jobs.ts` — process lifecycle changes need live verification,
  and a git diff cannot show that a job still survives its server.

## Commands

```sh
npm run build     # tsc -> dist/
npm run watch     # tsc --watch
npm test          # build, then node --test test/*.test.js
```

Tests run against the **compiled** `dist/` output, not the TypeScript sources, which is why `npm
test` builds first. They cover `handoff.ts` git parsing and `jobs.ts` state reconciliation; the
spawn path in `startJob` / `replyJob` is deliberately not covered, since exercising it needs either
real Codex runs or a fake binary that Windows cannot spawn without a shell. Verify that path by
driving the built server over stdio with a JSON-RPC script (initialize →
`notifications/initialized` → `tools/call`); see "Verifying changes" below.

`test/jobs.test.js` sets `CODEX_MCP_JOBS_DIR` to a temp dir **before** a dynamic `import()` of the
compiled module. `JOBS_DIR` is a module-level const evaluated at import time, so a static import
would aim the tests at the real job store in the user's home directory — where `pruneJobs` would
delete from it. Keep any new job test on that same dynamic-import pattern.

Registered with Claude Code at user scope as `codex-offload`. After `npm run build`, restart the
MCP connection for changes to take effect — a running server keeps the old `dist/`.

## Layout

- `src/index.ts` — MCP server, tool definitions and their descriptions
- `src/jobs.ts` — job lifecycle: spawn, state reconciliation, event parsing, cancel, prune
- `src/handoff.ts` — the report schema Codex must fill in, and git-based change verification
- `src/codexBin.ts` — locates the real Codex executable

## Architecture notes

**Jobs are detached and disk-backed.** State lives in `~/.codex-mcp/jobs/<jobId>/`
(`meta.json`, `events.jsonl`, `stderr.log`, `last-message.txt`, `prompt.txt`), not in memory,
because a job outlives the server process that started it. Never move job state into a module-level
map — a job started by a previous server would become unreadable.

**`running` is a claim, not a fact.** `getJob()` reconciles it against the pid: if the recorded
state is `running` but the process is gone, the job is resolved to `done` or `failed` depending on
whether a result file was produced. Any new code path that reads job state must go through
`getJob()` / `listJobs()` rather than reading `meta.json` directly.

**The prompt travels over stdin**, never as an argv element — it is arbitrary user text and can be
long. Keep it that way.

**Spawn without a shell.** `resolveCodexBin()` finds the real platform binary inside the npm
package so we can pass an argv array. The `useShell: true` fallback exists only for when that
resolution fails; do not make it the default path.

**stdout is the MCP transport.** Anything written to stdout corrupts the protocol. Diagnostics go
to stderr or nowhere. This is why startup pruning is wrapped in a bare `catch`.

**Event parsing is tolerant.** `events.jsonl` is parsed while Codex is still writing to it, so a
trailing partial line is normal — unparseable lines are skipped, never thrown on. Files are read
tail-first with a byte cap so a chatty job cannot exhaust memory.

**The handoff does not trust Codex's self-report.** `--output-schema` gets a typed report out of
Codex, but `codex_result` pairs it with `actualChanges` derived from git against a baseline
captured before the job started. Keep both. The report says what Codex believes it did; git says
what happened. Dropping the git half would leave nothing to check the model against.

**All git plumbing runs with `-z`.** This is not stylistic. In human-readable mode git quotes paths
containing spaces or non-ASCII, and does so *inconsistently between commands* —
`status --porcelain` yields `"with space.txt"` while `diff --name-status` yields `with space.txt`,
so baseline paths silently stop matching diff paths and every such file is misreported as not
preexisting. NUL-separated output is never quoted. Related: `git()` trims trailing whitespace only,
because `status --porcelain` encodes status in the first two columns and a leading trim would eat a
character off the first line's path. Both of these were real bugs.

## Codex CLI facts worth keeping

Verified against codex-cli 0.144.4:

- `codex exec --json` emits JSONL: `thread.started`, `turn.started`, `item.completed`
  (`item.type` of `agent_message` / `reasoning` / `command_execution` / `file_change`),
  `turn.completed` (with `usage`), `turn.failed`.
- `codex exec` reads the prompt from stdin when no prompt argument is given.
- `-o FILE` writes the final agent message; `-C DIR` sets the working root; `-s` sets the sandbox.
- `--output-schema FILE` constrains the final message to a JSON Schema. Every property must be
  listed in `required` with `additionalProperties: false`; partially-specified objects are rejected.
- `codex exec resume <SESSION_ID>` continues a thread with full context. It accepts `--json`, `-o`,
  `--output-schema`, `-m`, `-c` — but **not** `-C` or `-s`, which it inherits from the original
  session. The session id is the `thread_id` from the `thread.started` event.
- `-c model_reasoning_effort=<value>` sets reasoning effort for one run without touching
  `config.toml`. **Which values are legal depends on the model, not the CLI.** The generic API error
  advertises `none|minimal|low|medium|high|xhigh|max`, but `gpt-5.6-sol` accepts only
  `none|low|medium|high|xhigh` and rejects `minimal` and `max`. Codex does not validate locally — it
  forwards the value, so a bad one surfaces as an `error` + `turn.failed` event *after* the job has
  started, not as a spawn error. The zod enum at the tool boundary therefore catches typos only; it
  cannot promise a value will work.
- A failed turn's real cause is in `events.jsonl`, not `stderr.log`. stderr routinely leads with an
  unrelated `codex_models_manager::cache` warning, so prefer `summarizeEvents().failure` over a tail
  of stderr when reporting why a job failed.
- The real binary is at
  `<npm-root>/@openai/codex/node_modules/@openai/codex-<platform>/vendor/<triple>/bin/codex[.exe]`.
- On Windows the `codex.cmd` shim cannot be spawned without `shell: true` (Node throws `EINVAL`).

## Verifying changes

Exercise the real thing, not just the types — the interesting failures are in process lifecycle,
and `tsc` passing proves nothing about them. The paths that have actually broken or needed care:

- a job completing and its result being collected
- `codex_cancel` killing the whole process tree (Windows needs `taskkill /T /F`)
- a job surviving the server being killed, and a fresh server recovering its state
- an unknown job id returning a clean error rather than throwing
- `codex_reply` recalling context from the parent job
- change verification in a repo containing a file that was **already dirty** before the job, plus
  paths with spaces and non-ASCII names — this is where the git parsing bugs lived, and a repo of
  simple ASCII filenames will happily hide them
